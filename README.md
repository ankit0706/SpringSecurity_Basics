# Spring Security & Basic Authentication

When you create a RESTful service using Spring, its endpoints are not protected by default, meaning anyone can access them.
Enabling Basic Authentication
Once you add the Spring Security dependency to your pom.xml file, basic authentication is automatically activated. 

Basic authentication requires users to provide a username and password to access protected endpoints.

## Default Credentials

Default Username: user

Default Password: Generated by Spring and printed in the application logs

## Unauthorized Access
If anyone tries to access an API endpoint without providing valid credentials, they will receive a 401 (Unauthorized) status code.

## Testing with Postman
To test your API endpoints in Postman:
Navigate to the Authorization tab
Select Basic Auth from the dropdown
Enter your username and password

## Customizing Credentials
By default, the password is reset each time the application reboots. To use custom credentials:

Open your application.properties file
Add the following lines:

> spring.security.user.name=your_username
> 
> spring.security.user.password=your_password

Once you provide custom values, Spring will no longer use the default credentials, giving you full control over authentication.
